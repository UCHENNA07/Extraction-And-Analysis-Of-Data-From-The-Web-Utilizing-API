## Extraction-And-Analysis-Of-Data-From-The-Web-Utilizing-API
1. The primary aim of this project is to extract data from the web, format the data and analyze it.
2. To achieve that, the requests library was used for this project.
3. For web scapping to be successful, some data requires API key while some does not. So while scrapping the web, you should bare it in mind so as not to encounter error while executing your command.
4. Further analysis was carried on the data so as to return it in its most clean, readable and understandable form.
